Soundtrack is a music streaming service that amplifies experiences in commercial and public spaces. It was launched in 2016 by Spotify-backed startup, Soundtrack Your Brand.

As part of the team that just prior had created Spotify Business, I went on to work on Soundtrack. We set out with the high ambition to change the entire commercial music industry.
