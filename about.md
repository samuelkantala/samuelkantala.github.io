Hi I’m Samuel, a Swedish designer based in Montreal — I’m currently working on the product team at Breather, designing a network of spaces that are connected, productive and accessible.

From 2015 to 2017 I worked at Soundtrack Your Brand where I had the privilege to be an integral part of creating music streaming platforms Spotify Business and Soundtrack. I got to solve problems related to control, content and licensing, for small businesses as well as global enterprises. I also lead the UI design and created design systems to support multiple products and platforms.
