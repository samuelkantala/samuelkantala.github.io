Google Chrome Experiments is a showcase of work that pushes the boundaries of web technology, creating beautiful and unique web experiences.

For this project, Google teamed up with North Kingdom to create an immersive experience for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The result was an interactive WebGL 3D map of Middle-Earth which allowed users to explore the heroesâ€™ journeys through 27 unique locations. In addition, we created a peer-to-peer 3D battle experience running on WebRTC.

Together with the talented Jonas Eriksson, we managed to design a holistic visual experience that supported a multitude of features as wells as content from six movies shot over a decade apart. The process took us through high level concepts down to pixel pushing details as each of us got to have a stab at every aspect of the project.
