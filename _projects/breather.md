From 2017 to 2018 I worked as senior product designer on the experience team at the Breather HQ in Montreal. During that time, I designed and lead product initiatives focusing on how users discover and utilize Breather’s workspaces. Highlights include; the redesign of Breather’s web platform and mobile applications by implementing a reliable product design system, improving the search and booking experience, and contributing to business models /passport/ and /month+/.
