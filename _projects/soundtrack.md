Spotify Business is a powerful music streaming platform, licensed for commercial and public spaces. Itâ€™s a product specifically created to grow your business with music. It comes with tools to steer all of your locations from one place and schedule your music ahead of time based on the needs of your business.

I was fortunate to have been part of designing Spotify Business, from early concept, through launch, and into a fully profitable product. During that time I was given the chance to solve problems related to control, content, and licensing for small businesses as well as global enterprises. One of my most notable contributions was designing and maintaining the product design system.
