The International Center of Photography (ICP) is the world’s leading institution dedicated to photography and visual culture. It is based in New York and consists of a museum and a photography school. To date, ICP has presented more than 700 exhibitions and offered thousands of classes at every level.

In 2014 I was in involved in the digital redesign of ICP. The ambition was to bring ICP to new audiences and create a vibrant platform for them to share their work, cultural assets, and different points of view. The platform was designed to be a forum for engagement bringing all parts of ICP — the Museum, School, Collections, Store, and Library together.
