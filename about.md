After graduating Hyper Island in early 2013, I moved to New York to join the renowned design agency, Your Majesty. I ended up staying there for over a year before moving to North Kingdom where I stayed throughout 2014. During those two years I was fortunate to learn from and collaborate with some very talented individuals, while creating award winning experiences for the likes of Google, Warner Brothers and The New York Times.

From 2015 to 2017 I worked at Spotify backed startup, Soundtrack Your Brand. There, I had the privilege of having an integral part in creating music streaming platforms, Spotify Business and Soundtrack. I worked on problems related to control, content and licensing for small businesses as well as global enterprises.

Most recently I worked at Breather in Montreal, designing ways to access and utilise a connected network of flexible workspace.
