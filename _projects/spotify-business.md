Spotify Business is a powerful music streaming platform, licensed for commercial and public spaces. Itâ€™s a product specifically created to grow your business with music.

I joined the team at an early stage, and was part of taking Spotify Business from early concept, into a fully profitable product. During that time I got to work on a vast variety problems related to music, interface and business.
