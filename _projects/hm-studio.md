The H&M Studio collection is the brandâ€™s exclusive seasonal line that they present bi-annually at Paris Fashion Week. North Kingdom created an interactive lookbook to showcase each of the 14 key looks in the collection. The result was a slow motion catwalk where users can explore and purchase the garments from each look through subtle interactions. Additionally, the urban atmosphere was set with changing background videos with specific soundscape to emulate the mood each key look provoked.
