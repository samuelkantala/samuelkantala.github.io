I worked on Soundtrack from initial concept in 2015, through launch,  and until 2017. I was responsible for designing Soundtracks back office and  consumer facing mobile applications. Many of the design challenges I worked on were related to managing music; from individual users creating soundtracks, to global companies looking for a coherent brand sound across markets.
