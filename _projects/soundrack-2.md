subtitle: A new era in commercial music
description: Before 2018, Soundtrack Your Brand had been forced to juggle several product sub-brands due to licensing restrictions. In 2018, it could finally become one company, one product, one brand; Soundtrack. A brand to represent a new era in commercial music.
