Breather offers instant access to hundreds of spaces to expand your office, wherever you need it. It’s perfect for team meetings, offsites, workshops or anytime you just need to focus. The spaces are sourced and designed by Breather’s in-house team, who uses research to create spaces that help run productive meetings and spark creativity.

Since March 2017, I’ve been working as senior product designer on the experience team at Breather.
