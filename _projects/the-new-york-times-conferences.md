The New York Times conferences bring together leaders from around the world to deepen understanding of vital topics, advance innovative solutions to major challenges and provide new opportunities for businesses, from higher education, finance and technology to energy and the luxury market.

The New York Times approached Your Majesty to help build an online platform to allow their editorial teams to create and publish custom conferences that fit into a cohesive, expandable experience. We designed a modular system that enabled editors to easily build custom layouts from a breadth of features to suit each conference’s style and needs while maintaining overall brand consistency. The modular system allows for a smart publishing tool to manage the before, during and after states for each conference – helping attendees get information, register before, view agendas and locations during, and sift through the summaries afterwards.
